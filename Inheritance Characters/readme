Here, we see two examples of inheritance and function visibility within blockchain games, through solidity and move.
We aren't dealing with a specific vulnerability in this case, but rather showcase the method
by which move has the same functioanlities as solidity.
In solidity, we use typical inheritance and function overriding
Move supports these same functionalities through its version of inheritance as well. We simply
'use' a module located at user 0x1's address, and by doing so gain the inherited functions of this module.
In move, the original functions can only be altered from within the module they were instantiated, which
adds an extra layer of security for module developers.
