In the game "kingdom", 
a multiplayer blockchain game where player resources are written on-chain

players can borrow coins to fund their operations,
and wars with other players may increase their debt.

Solidity Vulnerability: 
However, in solidity if debt reaches the max value for uint, it will reset to 0.
Players can exploit this by increasing their debt until it reaches max value, in which case it will reset to 0. They can thus eliminate their debt through this exploit.

Move Solution: 
In move, howveer, we can write spec functions to ensure player debt interactions (borrowing and attacking) will never result in a integer overflow for that palyer's debt value, ensuring this exploit cannot be used.
